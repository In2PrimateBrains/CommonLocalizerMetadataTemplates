# Common Localizer Data Standard

## In2PrimateBrains

[In2PrimateBrains (In2PB)](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/in2pb/) is an EU Innovative Training Network dedicated to the study of neuronal intra and inter-areal communication in non-human primate brains.

## Common Localizer Protocols

Common localizers are a set of standardized tasks and conditions performed by In2PB labs, generating recordings that can be aggregated and compared, across different brain regions and with different recording modalities.
