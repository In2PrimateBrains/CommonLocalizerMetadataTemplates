,softwareVersion,,,,RECOMMENDED,Manufacturer’s designation of the data acquisition software.,,,,
,deviceSerialNumber,,,,RECOMMENDED,"The serial number of the equipment that produced the data. A pseudonym can also be used to prevent the equipment from being identifiable, as long as each pseudonym is unique within the dataset.",,,,
